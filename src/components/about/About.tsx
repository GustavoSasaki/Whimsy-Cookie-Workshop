                        Founded by a group of friends with a shared passion for baking and vintage culture, Whimsy Cookie Workshop has been a labor of love since 2015. From the very first batch of cookies, we aimed to transport our customers to simpler times, where cookies were more than just treats; they were gateways to cherished memories.

                        As we've grown, our commitment to quality, community, and sustainability has remained unwavering. We proudly source local ingredients, support eco-conscious practices, and aim to be a warm, inviting space for SÃ£o Carlos and beyond.
