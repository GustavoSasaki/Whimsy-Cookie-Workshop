            Founded by a group of friends with a shared passion for baking and
            vintage culture, Whimsy Cookie Workshop has been a labor of love
            since 2015. From the very first batch of cookies, we aimed to
            transport our customers to simpler times, where cookies were more
            than just treats; they were gateways to cherished memories.
            <br className="mb-4" />
            As we&apos;ve grown, our commitment to quality, community, and
            sustainability has remained unwavering. We proudly source local
            ingredients, support eco-conscious practices, and aim to be a warm,
            inviting space for SÃ£o Carlos and beyond.

            Join us at Whimsy Cookie Workshop and be part of our journey, where
            every cookie is a step back in time and every visit is an
            opportunity to create sweet memories.
